This repository includes all the puzzles solutions. Reading ahead will spoil parts of the experience. The game is built around discovery and solving things on your own, and going in blind is the best way to play. If you haven't started yet, consider holding off on using this guide until you've given it a fair shot. Use it only when you're stuck or aiming to complete everything.
